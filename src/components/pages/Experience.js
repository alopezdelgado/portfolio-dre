        <h3>Mount Mercy University</h3>
        <p> During my pursuit of a bachelor's degree in biology at Mount Mercy University, I not only excelled academically but also actively engaged in campus life, fostering a well-rounded college experience. Beyond the classroom, I was a dedicated member of the women's soccer team, where I honed my teamwork, discipline, and determination on the field. This experience taught me valuable life skills that complemented my academic journey.

        My involvement extended beyond athletics as I also served as a member of the Student Government Association (SGA). This role allowed me to connect with my peers, advocate for student needs, and contribute to the vibrant campus community. My dedication and commitment to the betterment of the university community were recognized when I was honored with the President's Award. This award celebrated my tenacity, dedication, compassion, and heart, traits that I carry with me in all aspects of my life.

        Throughout my time at Mount Mercy University, I maintained a strong academic record, reflecting my unwavering commitment to learning and growth. My academic achievements, combined with my involvement in campus activities, reinforced my belief in the importance of a holistic education that encompasses both intellectual and personal development. These experiences have laid a strong foundation for my journey to bridge the worlds of technology and biology, driven by a desire to make a meaningful impact on society.</p>
        <h3>LEARN Academy</h3>
        <p>My journey to bridge technology and biology has taken an exciting turn as I embark on a new chapter in my life. I am currently enrolled in a Full Stack Web Developer bootcamp at LEARN Academy, where I am immersing myself in the world of coding. This program marks the beginning of a thrilling adventure into the realm of technology, as I strive to acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to merge my passion for biology with the power of web development.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        In this intensive bootcamp, I am learning a comprehensive set of web development technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React JS, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and PostgreSQL. These tools are the building blocks of modern web applications, and I am enthusiastic about mastering them to create innovative solutions at the intersection of biology and technology. This immersive learning experience represents the first step toward realizing my vision of a future where technology and biology work harmoniously to address some of society's most pressing challenges. I am excited to embrace the challenges, grow as a developer, and ultimately contribute to the advancement of both biology and healthcare through the fusion of these two distinct yet interconnected worlds.
