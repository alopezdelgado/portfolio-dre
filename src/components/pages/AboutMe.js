        <p>
        I am a native of Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, a vibrant border city that has shaped my perspective on life and culture. I embarked on my academic journey with a passion for the natural world, earning a bachelor's degree in biology. Throughout my studies, I delved deep into the intricacies of life and the environment, fostering a profound curiosity about the intersection of technology and biology.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        My current endeavor involves learning how to code, a skill that I believe will serve as a powerful tool in bridging the gap between these two seemingly disparate fields. This journey is driven by my ultimate career goal of harnessing technology to enhance our understanding of biology, whether through cutting-edge research, data analysis, or innovative solutions that improve healthcare and environmental conservation.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        I am excited to embark on this path of discovery, where I can leverage my diverse background to make meaningful contributions to the world of science and technology. 
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        In addition to my academic pursuits and passion for biology and technology, I also have a practical side rooted in healthcare. Prior to delving into coding, I worked as a Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA). This experience provided me with a unique perspective on the healthcare industry, giving me firsthand insight into patient care, the importance of data-driven decision-making, and the potential for technology to revolutionize healthcare delivery.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        As a CNA, I witnessed the daily challenges faced by healthcare professionals and patients alike. This experience has fueled my desire to merge my biology background with technology to create solutions that can streamline healthcare processes, improve patient outcomes, and make healthcare more accessible and efficient.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        My journey is not just about acquiring coding skills; it's about using these skills to make a tangible impact on the world, particularly in the fields of biology and healthcare. I am determined to bridge the gap between these two domains, drawing from my diverse experiences and education to create innovative solutions that have the potential to transform lives and advance our understanding of the natural world. The fusion of biology, technology, and healthcare is where my true passion lies, and I am excited to see where this journey will take me in the future.
